    <p class="para">A delicious Hawaiian recipe! Spam and rice wrapped in seaweed 
    is the perfect svaoury snack.</p>
<h4 class="header">Ingredients</h4>
    <ul class="list">
        <li>12 ounces Spam</li>
        <li>1/4 cup oyster sauce</li>
        <li>1/4 cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>1/2 cup sugar</li>
        <li>Nori roasted seaweed used for sushi, 
            cut into halves or thirds </li>
        <li>6 cups cooked sushi rice WITHOUT 
            the vinegar mixture added</li>
    </ul>
<h4 class="header">Steps</h4>
    <ol class="list">
        <li>Slice the SPAM into about 8-10 slices 
            (depending on how thick you like it) and put in 
            a Ziplock bag. Mix oyster sauce, soy sauce, and 
            sugar until sugar is dissolved and add to the bag 
            with the SPAM. Marinate for about 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Drain off marinade and fry SPAM on each side over 
            medium heat until slightly crispy or until desired 
            doneness. Some people like to glaze the SPAM with 
            the marinade/sauce AFTER frying, either way tastes 
            great! </li>
        <li>Place a strip of nori on a cutting board or clean 
            surface (shiny side down). Place your Musubi mold 
            across the middle of the nori. Add Sushi Rice to 
            the mold, pressing down firmly and evenly so there 
            is about 1-1 Â½ inches of rice. Dip the mold and your 
            fingers in water as you go to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li>Next, remove the mold from the rice. Now you will 
            have a nice little block of rice right on the nori. 
            Add some of the cooked SPAM to the top. Wrap up one 
            side of the nori and stick it to the top of the 
            SPAM, then wrap up the other side. Just like you 
            are wrapping a nice little package. Use a little 
            water on your finger to seal if needed. 
            Serve warm.</li>
        <li>Some like it dipped in soy sauce, some like it 
            with ketchup, and some like it as is.</li>
    </ol>
