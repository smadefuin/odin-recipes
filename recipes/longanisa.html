<h3 id="title">Skinless Longanisa</h3>
    <p class="para">This is a basic and skinless version of the classic
        Filipino sausage called Longanisa. It is sweet and
        garlicky. For a delicious breakfast or meal, it
        pairs perfectly with sinangag (garlic fried rice) 
        and eggs.</p>
<h4 class="header">Ingredients</h4>
        <ul class="list">
            <li >1 ¾ lbs. ground pork</li>
            <li> tablespoons dark brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon smoked paprika</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 ¼ tablespoons coarse salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>2 head garlic</li>
        </ul>
<h4 class="header">Steps</h4>
        <ol class="list">
            <li>Peel the skin off the garlic cloves. 
            Crush thoroughly using mortar and pestle.
             Mince the crushed garlic. Set aside.</li>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine 
            ground pork along with all of the ingredients. 
            Mix well.</li>
            <li>Cover the bowl. Refrigerate for 2 hours.</li>
            <li>Shape the longganisa by laying a sheet of wax paper 
                on a flat surface. 
                Scoop around 3 tablespoons of mixture and put over the 
                wax paper. Fold the wax paper from top to down until the 
                mixture covered. Hold the edge of the paper with your 
                fingers and then slide the card towards the mixture. 
                Push a bit more until a sausage shape is formed. 
                Do this step until the entire mixture is consumed.</li>
